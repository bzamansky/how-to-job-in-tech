                <h3 class="card-title">Looking for an Internship as a Freshman</h3>
                <p>
                    Most companies will only be looking for students who have experience
                    with Data Structures and Algorithms for their normal Software Engineering 
                    internships.  But there are still companies that will hire 
                    Freshmen/Sophomores with little to no experience.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at the minimum qualifications for the job.  Some jobs will specify 
                    that they don't need as much experience for the internship.  And some 
                    will specifically target Freshman and Sophomores.  For example, the 
                    <a href="https://www.metacareers.com/careerprograms/pathways/metauniversity">Meta University</a> 
                    program or the 
                    <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step">Google Step</a> 
                    program.  I'd also recommend looking at non-tech companies that have technical roles.

                <p>
                    Most companies will only be looking for students who have experience
                    with Data Structures and Algorithms for their normal Software Engineering

                    Look at the minimum qualifications for the job.  Some jobs will specify 
                    that they don't need as much experience for the internship. And if you don't
                    get an internship right away, there are other opportunities you can pursue.
                    There are bootcamps you can sign up for, and self-learning you can do.  You 
                    can look into summer classes to get ahead in your degree.  Or you can work 
                    on personal projects to stretch your coding skills!  Find problems that you 
                    are interested in solving and see what your current CS skills can do to 
                    solve the problem.  Projects will look great on your resume and help you 
                    get an internship or job in the future.

                <p>If you are graduating in under a year, you likely
                    should be looking for a full time job. Most companies, especially 
                    the larger ones, only allow students to apply for internships if 
                    they will be returning to school after the summer is over.  Now, this 
                    is not always the case, and smaller companies may be happy to let 
                    you apply for an internship after you have graduated.  But be aware 
                    that this is not likely.

        <h2>Resumes</h2>
        <div id="resume" class="info">
            Everyone has the potential to create a great resume even if you
            have no technical job / internship experience (class projects,
            personal projects, and more can show your software experience).
        </div>

        <div id="resume10Sec" class="info">
            Recruiters spend under 10 seconds looking at a resume. Your job,
            above all else, is to make your resume skimmable. Someone should
            be able to get a sense of your experience and skills in just a
            couple of seconds. This is the one test every resume needs to be
            able to pass - it doesn't matter if it looks fancy or plain, if
            you won this hackathon or built that project - none of that
            matters if it's not easy to read.
        </div>

        <div id="resumeRules" class="info">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    One Page
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Your resume should fit on one page, no exceptions.
                            Better yet, your resume should take up exactly one
                            page, so there shouldn't be a lot of empty space either.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    Use a Template
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You can find resume templates online, on the your college's
                            career center site, and on this cheat sheet. But you have
                            to use a template. Do not go rogue and try to work your
                            own document magic — the best way to be easy to read is
                            to give recruiters what they're used to seeing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can use just about any template as long as it's easy to
                            read. The only rule for fonts, colors, layouts, etc, is to
                            not overdo it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Non-negotiable sections
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Most resume templates will contain some pre-defined sections,
                            like “Education,” “Experience,” “Awards”, “Publications,” etc.
                            There is no one right set of sections to have on a resume -
                            if you're the leader of a student club and that's an important
                            part of your life, your resume will look a little different
                            from someone who plays on the football team, and that one will
                            look different from someone who already has or has had a job,
                            or several.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            That said, EVERY technical resume should contain four core sections:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Contact info: the very top of the resume should list your name,
                                    email, LinkedIn, and GitHub. Some people include addresses and
                                    phone numbers, but it's not strictly necessary.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Education: describing where you go to school, when you'll graduate,
                                    and what courses you've taken
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Project Experience: describing what you've built using your
                                    technical skills
                                </li>

        <h2>Applying for Internships / Full Time Jobs</h2>

        <div id="applications" class="info">
            <h3>Applications Information</h3>
            <p>
                Now that you have a resume, you're ready to start applying for internships.
                You can search on Linkedin, Handshake, indeed, Google jobs, or other sites
                to find companies hiring for interns. I'd recommend looking both locally
                at companies that have tech roles and elsewhere in the country for
                internships that sound interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                START APPLYING EARLY. Be aware of recruiting cycles. A decent rule of
                thumb is that the best time to apply is in the first half of a given
                semester. Companies are looking as early as September of one year for
                employees to start work after the Summer of the next year. That being
                said, it is never “too late” to apply, including a couple months
                before a job starts (and in some cases, much shorter time frames apply).
            </p>
            <p>
                Check the minimum qualifications. For international students, most of
                these will mention if the company will sponsor visas or not. Apply to
                anything you're interested in, even if you're not nominally qualified
                for it, e.g. if it says “new grad” but says they want Python experience ...
                even if you don't have it, you can still apply. Especially when you're
                trying to get your first internship, you will likely get more rejections
                than you want. But you only need one acceptance, so keep trying!
                Something will come through in the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some companies may ask for cover letters with your application. You can
                have a somewhat standard cover letter that you use as a base for every
                company, but make sure to change it for each company you apply for.
                Before an interview, and hence before you apply, you'll want to know a
                bit about the company you are applying for. Talking about why you want
                to work there, with regards to what the company does, will be important
                in both a cover letter and your interview.

            Now that you've gotten your resume ready and you've started applying
            for jobs, you need to make sure you're ready for the interviews.
            Ideally you've started doing interview prep even before applying for jobs.
        </div>
        <div id="interviewPrep" class="info">
            <p>
                Do your research for the particular company / role you're applying for,
                including asking the recruiter directly what you might be able to expect
                in the interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                Practice is so important
            </p>
            <p>
                We can view interviewing like a sport or a new game. You have “building
                muscles / athleticism” through your coursework, but even athletic people
                need to practice to become good at a sport that's new to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some research shows that you double your chances of passing a technical
                interview once you have done 5+ interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                Failing your technical interview does NOT mean you are not a good engineer.
                It just means you need more practice at the “game” of interviewing.

                    Coding interviews are NOT
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            exactly the same kind of work engineers are doing every day

                            the same across all companies

                <li>
                    Failing your technical interview does NOT mean you are not a good engineer.
                    It just means you need more practice at the “game” of interviewing. It is
                    a game / skill to practice like anything else, which is unfortunately
                    sometimes disjoint from what you learned in school.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You do NOT have to write mistake-free code to get a “hire” decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You shouldn't expect to engage with the interviewer much. During the
                    coding portion, many interviewers will let the candidate drive. Don't
                    be anxious about the lack of engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some tech interview formats and tech interviewers are generally cold
                    / distant and not friendly. It is unfortunate that this is the reality,
                    but when you see it, just know it is not a reflection on you and
                    instead a reflection on them / the culture of their interviews.

                    LeetCode
                    <ul>
                        To work through LeetCode efficiently, there are curated lists of
                        questions that are particularly useful for interviews:
                        <a href="https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/">LeetCode Patterns</a>,
                        <a href="https://bit.ly/leetCodeCommonPatterns">Questions by Patterns</a>.
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mock Interviews (pair up with a friend if nothing else!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Online courses / videos
                </li>
            </ul>
            Your priorities should be: (in this order)
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You want to be able to write code like a fish can swim (once you have an
                    algorithm down, you can convert it to code easily)
                </li>
                <li>
                    You want to have practiced the code interview format, specifically
                </li>
                <li>
                    You want to be proficient in as many algorithmic topics as possible.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These priorities are in order, so don't go and practice graph algorithms if
                you don't feel like you can take an easy problem and just go in whatever
                language you're best at. Things like being able to write a binary search,
                reverse a string, or any other "easy" coding tasks (they can even be greedy
                /naive approaches to harder problems). The way to test this is to do practice
                questions where the solution is immediately obvious to you, or you already
                know it, and see if you can write correct code pretty quickly. If you haven't
                ever done this before, LeetCode and HackerRank are great sites to get
                questions, write code, and see if it works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've cleared that first hurdle, it's time to get comfortable solving
                questions with an audience. The second most important tip I have for you in
                this module is this: practice interviews with other people. You can be
                really good at solving coding questions alone in your room and then walk
                into an interview and freeze up. This is because communicating with an
                interviewer adds another layer of difficulty to the interview question, so
                it's not uncommon to get confused on problems you'd have no trouble with
                under normal circumstances. Practicing by having someone else pretend to
                interview you is the absolute best bet here, because you'll have to simulate
                that process of thinking out loud with another actual human.

        <div id="interviewsOtherTypes" class="info">
            <h3>Other Types of Technical Interviews</h3>
            <p>
                Aside from coding interviews, there are other technical interviews you might encounter.
                For the most part, these take significantly less time to prepare for than the coding
                interviews you may see, but it is still important to practice and be aware of them,
                especially because many smaller and older companies rely on them more than coding
                interviews. The formats include
            </p>
            <p>
                Project experience: they may ask you about a previous project you've done and ask you
                to explain how you built it, why you made certain design decisions, bugs that you
                encountered and fixed, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Domain-specific: they may ask questions about particular technologies or workflows.
                For example, if you are interviewing for an iOS or Android app development position,
                they might ask some questions specific to that role. If the role is a more general
                role, there may be less domain-specific knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Object-oriented / language-related programming trivia: they may ask questions related
                to topics you may have learned in school like “what is inheritance”, “what are classes
                used for”, “explain what a pointer is”, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that you do not need to answer every question perfectly to get an offer and be a
                good fit for the job. Also, asking your recruiter in advance what kind of interview it
                might be (e.g. “Will I expect a traditional coding interview or might they also ask
                some mobile development questions? Will they be interested in discussing my previous
                projects?”) is the best way to know what to prepare for for a particular opportunity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="interviewsBehavioral" class="info">
            <h3>Behavioral Interviews</h3>
            <p>
                Teamwork is very important in industry, and these interviews are used to judge your
                fit and maturity here. They want to see you are an effective team player and
                individual contributor: empathetic, good at resolving conflicts, clear with
                communicating, motivated, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each question, think to yourself “What is the interviewer trying to understand
                about me?” and answer authentically with an appropriate example.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For example, with “What is your biggest weakness”, the interviewer is
                    assessing your self-awareness and growth mindset.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For “Tell me about a time you worked with someone you disagreed with”,
                    they are assessing if you can work on a team, handle difficult situations,
                    and exercise empathy for your teammates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Be sure to reflect beforehand on your strengths and weaknesses and be prepared to talk about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be prepared to talk about the projects on your resume and why you were excited to build them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research your company's culture, values, and mission to answer “Why do you want to work at
                this company”.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the process of researching your company, note if there are any principles / values that
                should influence your answer. For example, a value of “Be Frugal / Smart with Expenses”
                would suggest the company values being savvy about how to cut costs while still achieving
                results, while “Achieve More Impact with More Resources” would suggest alternative company
                values. If natural, you can reflect these in your answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prepare stories / examples for common interview questions. Consider using the STAR
                format when asked to “tell me about a time when…”
